The Momentum Shadow Developer is now fully operational in both CLI and Discord modes.

High-level summary:
1. Core Engine: Stateless, handles planning and execution separately.
2. Discord Bot: Live and providing the "human-in-the-loop" approval flow.
3. Next: Moving to Cloud Deployment (Firebase Functions).

I will continue with the deployment configuration.
